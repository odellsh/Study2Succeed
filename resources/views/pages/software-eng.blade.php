        <p> The Observer Pattern has a one-to-many dependancy between the objects that are created.
            If an object changes its state, all of the objects that are dependant upon that object,
            otherwise known as observers, will be notified and updated. The observers may also be
            updated with new data and information. An implementation of this pattern typically
            includes 2 interfaces, a subject interface and an observer interface.
